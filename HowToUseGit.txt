- git init -
1. cd into your directory and run: "git init". This initializes a Git repository in that folder, adding a .git folder within it.

- git add -
1. This command moves your files to the staging area so you can commit them. You do that with: "git add .". The period simply means to stage everything, but you could be more specific, for example "git add *.js" or "git add index.php".

- git commit - 
1. After staging, we need to commit: "git commit". This launches Vi and asks
you to type a message. You can also do "git commit -m "my message"" to skip
this.
2. The -a allows you stage all modified files and commit at the same time. Ex:
"git commit -am "Initial Commit"".

- git status - 
1. To see the current status of your code, type "git status".

- git branch/checkout - 
1. This command allows you to branch a project so that if modifications don't
work, there's no harm done.
2. To list your branches: "git branch".
3. To create a branch: "git branch myBranch".
4. To switch to a branch: "git checkout myBranch".

- git merge - 
1. To merge a branch, type "git merge myBranch" while on the branch you want
it to merge to.
2. To delete a branch: "git branch -d myBranch".
3. To delete a branch that you have not merged: "git branch -D myBranch".

- git log -
1. To output a list of all the commits: "git log".
2. To output all commits with graphics: "git log --graph".

- GitHub - 
-- Git Clone --
1. If you find a project you want to clone: "git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git".
2. This creates a folder and copies the whole repository to your computer.

-- Git Push --
1. First, create a repository in GitHub.com. GitHub will give you a public
clone URL and a personal clone URL. 
2. Go back to the project in the terminal and type: "git remote add romri
git@github.com:RommelTJ/Algorithms.git". This creates a link to the remote
repository at GitHub under name "romri".
3. You will have to pull and merge the changes first: "git pull romri master".
4. Then, "git add ."
5. "git commit -am "GitHub Commit"".
6. Finally, push it into GitHub: "git push romri master".
